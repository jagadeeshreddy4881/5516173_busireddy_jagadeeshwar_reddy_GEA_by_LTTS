Learning experience with Agile for Beginners from Great Learning :
ðŸ“˜ Learning Update â€“ Agile for Beginners
Iâ€™ve recently completed the Agile for Beginners course offered by Great Learning.
Though this course doesnâ€™t provide a certificate for free, the knowledge I gained is truly valuable. I learned the fundamentals of Agile methodology including:
âœ… Agile principles and mindset
 âœ… Scrum framework and roles
 âœ… Sprint planning and retrospectives
 âœ… Real-world applications of Agile in teams
This learning experience has helped me gain a deeper understanding of how modern teams collaborate, iterate, and deliver value effectively.
ðŸ“Œ No certificate? No problem. Learning is about growth, not just credentials.
